This project styles were written using LESS preprocessor.

All of the colors are saved in variables file, so if in the future this color palette changes, it will be easy to restyle this page.

Layout was made with BEM class name rules and styles for this components are placed in different directories for a quick navigation

For the interactive map i used Leaflet library, and for the slider - Swiper libraby. 

In case js will not be working on the client's side i made all interactive elements with safety precaution: 
For the map - there is a background image underneath with the exact geo position.

For the slider - i hid the arrows, so it will look like one simple promo block.

And for the mobile burger menu - nav block is shown, button is hidden and menu's position changes from absolute to static, so it will not block promo-content
